# mutREAD

This repository contains a R script (src/simulations.R with session information in src/simulations_sessionInfo.R) to examplify the computational simulation for the mutREAD paper. It describes the application of the computational simulations to the example data provided in the data folder. 

The example data comprise:
* a test vcf file which represents the sample-wise, whole-genome sequencing derived mutations
* esophageal adenocarcinoma-derived mutational signatures from Secrier et al. 2016
* example bed files capturing the investigated targeted regions (i.e. reduced representation and (expanded) exome)
